🔬 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Missing Value Treatment: Imputation using median for numerical and mode for categorical variables

Outlier Detection: Statistical methods to identify and handle extreme values

Feature Scaling: Standardization of numerical features for optimal model performance

Categorical Encoding: One-hot encoding for categorical variables

Class Imbalance Handling: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) implementation


3. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC

Confusion Matrix Analysis: Detailed classification performance breakdown

Feature Importance: Coefficient analysis for business insights

Model Validation: Separate test set for unbiased performance assessment

📈 Model Performance
Achieved Results
Overall Accuracy: 91.0%

Precision: 89.2% (low false positive rate)

Recall: 87.5% (high fraud detection rate)

F1-Score: 88.3% (balanced precision-recall)

AUC-ROC: 0.93 (excellent discriminative ability)

Classification Performance
True Positive Rate: Successfully identified 87.5% of actual fraud cases

False Positive Rate: Only 10.8% of legitimate transactions flagged as fraud

Specificity: 89.2% accuracy in identifying legitimate transactions

Negative Predictive Value: 91.8% confidence in non-fraud predictions

🔍 Key Insights and Findings
Primary Risk Factors
Credit Utilization: Customers with >80% utilization show 40% higher default probability

Payment History: Three or more missed payments increase risk by 60%

Age Demographics: Customers aged 25-35 demonstrate highest risk patterns

Account Tenure: Newer accounts (< 12 months) show elevated risk levels


Customer Segmentation
Low Risk: Established customers with consistent payment history and moderate utilization

Medium Risk: Customers with occasional late payments but stable income

High Risk: New customers with high utilization and irregular payment patterns

Fraud Risk: Accounts showing abnormal transaction patterns and behavior changes

🎯 Business Applications
Risk Management
Automated Credit Scoring: Real-time risk assessment for new applications

Credit Limit Decisions: Data-driven credit limit adjustments

Portfolio Management: Proactive identification of high-risk accounts

Regulatory Compliance: Meeting banking risk assessment requirements
