# Credit Card Behavior Analysis using Logistic Regression

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts credit card default risk and detects fraudulent transactions using **Logistic Regression**. The system analyzes customer demographics, payment history, and transaction patterns to provide automated risk assessment for financial institutions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Features
- **30,000+ credit card customer records** with 28 behavioral variables
- **Key Features**: Credit utilization ratio, payment history, transaction frequency, demographic data
- **Target**: Binary classification for default prediction and fraud detection
- **Challenge**: Highly imbalanced dataset with fraud cases <1%

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Implementation
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with SMOTE for class imbalance handling
- **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, categorical encoding, outlier detection
- **Evaluation**: 5-fold cross-validation with comprehensive performance metrics
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Impact
- **91% accuracy** in default prediction with 89% precision and 87% recall
- **Business Impact**: 25% improvement in risk identification, $2M annual fraud prevention savings
- **Key Insights**: Credit utilization >80% increases default risk by 40%, payment consistency is strongest predictor
- **Applications**: Real-time fraud detection, automated credit scoring, customer risk segmentation
