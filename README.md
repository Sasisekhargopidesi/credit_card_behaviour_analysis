Recall: 87.5% (high fraud detection rate)

F1-Score: 88.3% (balanced precision-recall)

AUC-ROC: 0.93 (excellent discriminative ability)

Classification Performance
True Positive Rate: Successfully identified 87.5% of actual fraud cases

False Positive Rate: Only 10.8% of legitimate transactions flagged as fraud

Specificity: 89.2% accuracy in identifying legitimate transactions

Negative Predictive Value: 91.8% confidence in non-fraud predictions

🔍 Key Insights and Findings
Primary Risk Factors
Credit Utilization: Customers with >80% utilization show 40% higher default probability

Payment History: Three or more missed payments increase risk by 60%

Age Demographics: Customers aged 25-35 demonstrate highest risk patterns

Account Tenure: Newer accounts (< 12 months) show elevated risk levels

Behavioral Patterns
Transaction Frequency: Sudden changes in spending patterns indicate potential fraud

Geographic Patterns: Transactions outside usual locations trigger risk assessment

Merchant Categories: High-risk merchant types correlate with increased fraud probability

Time-based Patterns: Unusual transaction timing patterns indicate suspicious activity

Customer Segmentation
Low Risk: Established customers with consistent payment history and moderate utilization

Medium Risk: Customers with occasional late payments but stable income

High Risk: New customers with high utilization and irregular payment patterns

Fraud Risk: Accounts showing abnormal transaction patterns and behavior changes
